## Security Appliances

Security appliances can be standalone devices like a router or software tools that are run on a network device. They fall into six general categories.

1. Routers

# functionalities

# i. Firewall Functionality

-Most routers come with built-in firewalls that block unwanted incoming traffic.
-They use NAT (Network Address Translation) to hide internal IP addresses.

# ii. Wireless Security Settings

-Supports WPA2/WPA3 encryption to secure Wi-Fi communication.
-Can restrict access by MAC address filtering.

# iii. Access Control

-Allows configuration of port forwarding, VPN support, and parental controls.
-Can block specific websites, services, or devices.

# iv.Traffic Monitoring

-Monitors inbound and outbound traffic to detect unusual activity.
-Some advanced routers offer intrusion detection and prevention (IDS/IPS).

# v. Firmware Updates

-Keeping router firmware updated ensures protection from newly discovered vulnerabilities.

While not as advanced as enterprise-level firewalls, a home or small-office router acts as a first line of defense, making it an essential security appliance in any network.

2. Firewall

A firewall is a security appliance or software that acts as a barrier between your internal network and external threats like the internet. Its job is to monitor, filter, and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on security rules.

# i. Traffic Filtering

-Allows or blocks data packets based on defined security rules (e.g., IP address, port number, protocol).

# ii. Prevent Unauthorized Access

-Blocks hackers, malware, or suspicious traffic from accessing your network or system.

# iii. Monitors Network Activity

-Logs and tracks network activity for auditing and detecting suspicious behavior.

# iv. Establishes a Security Perimeter

-Acts as a first line of defense at the edge of your network (like a border checkpoint).

As computer and network attacks have become more sophisticated, new types of firewalls have been developed, which serve different purposes.

1. Network Layer firewall

This filters communications based on source and destination IP addresses.

2. Transport Layer firewall

Filters communications based on source and destination data ports, as well as connection states.

3. Application Layer firewall

Filters communications based on an application, program or service.

4. Context aware layer firewall

Filters communications based on the user, device, role, application type and threat profile.

5. Proxy server

Filters web content requests like URLs, domain names and media types.

6. Reverse proxy server

Placed in front of web servers, reverse proxy servers protect, hide, offload and distribute access to web servers.

7. Network address translation (NAT) firewall

This firewall hides or masquerades the private addresses of network hosts.

8. Host-based firewall

Filters ports and system service calls on a single computer operating system.


3. Intrusion prevention systems(ISP)

ISP systems use a set of traffic signatures that match and block malicious traffic and attacks.

4. Virtual private networks(VPN)

VPN systems let remote employees use a secure encrypted tunnel from their mobile computer and securely connect back to the organization's network.

VPN systems can also securely interconnect branch offices with the central office network.

5. Antimalware or antivirus

These systems use signatures or behavioral analysis of applications to identify and block malicious code from being executed.

6. Other security devices

Other security devices include web and email security appliance, decryption devices, client access control servers and security management systems.
