## SecurityPal Ethics
SecurityPal is a company that helps businesses handle security questionnaires — the long lists of questions companies ask each other to check whether their data is safe. These questionnaires are extremely important in B2B cybersecurity, especially when companies want to work together.

SecurityPal has just reached a big milestone:

🎉 They answered 2 million security questions!

And large companies like OpenAI, Airtable, Figma, and Stack Overflow trust them for this work.

### Why These 2 Million Questions Matter

Security questionnaires are getting:
- Bigger (more questions)
- More complicated (topics like ESG, AI ethics, cloud security)
- More urgent (companies want fast security approvals)

On average, each questionnaire now has 113 questions.

Many businesses still send these questionnaires in Excel, but more are moving to online portals.

### How SecurityPal Started

- The founder, Pukar Hamal, saw companies constantly delayed because of long and repetitive security questionnaires.
- He wanted to simplify the process so businesses could close deals faster.
- The company grew from a small 8-person remote team to a global operation.
- They opened the SecurityPal Operations Command Center (SOCC) in Nepal.
- They raised $21 million from investors.

### Key Things SecurityPal Built

- SecurityPal built many tools to make the process smoother:
- SecurityPal Prime — answers questionnaires within 24 hours
- SOCC — 24/7/365 operations
- Multilingual support — answers in different languages
- AI Copilot — uses AI to generate faster, more accurate answers
- Vendor Assessment — checks third-party risks
- Assurance Profile — helps companies show their security posture clearly

### What SecurityPal Learns From 2 Million Questions

Companies are asking more about:

- Data protection
- Access control
- Incident management
- Cloud security
- ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance)
- AI ethics (fairness, transparency, accountability)
New laws like DORA, NIS2, and NIST CSF 2.0 are also forcing companies to be more strict about security.

### How SecurityPal Actually Works

Their process uses AI + expert analysts:

- AI reads and understands the questionnaire.
- Human analysts clarify details with the client.
- They use a huge Knowledge Library (past answered questions) to write accurate responses.
- They finish questionnaires in 70 hours, and under 12 hours with SP Prime.
- They review client edits and continuously improve.

### Impact on Businesses

SecurityPal helps businesses:
- Close deals faster
- Improve their security
- Stay compliant with regulations
- Build trust with customers
- Reduce workload for internal teams

### Case Study 

Productive, a company, used to take 2 weeks to fill questionnaires.
With SecurityPal, they now just review answers in 30 minutes, and the whole process finishes in 3–4 days.
This saves time and helps them focus on security risks instead of paperwork.

### Future of SecurityPal

SecurityPal plans to:
- Keep improving AI tools
- Adapt to new cybersecurity rules
- Help companies manage supply chain risks
- Support stricter requirements around AI security
- They want a future where companies can quickly, safely, and confidently work together without delays.

#### Q. Based on Anthony Sielczak's insights, what is one effective strategy for navigating the early stages of a career in GRC?
Volunteer to respond to client security questionnaires to understand security practices.

1. Access Control (Who can access what?)
- How do you manage employee access to systems?
- Do you use MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)?
- How do you revoke access when an employee leaves?

2. Data Protection & Encryption
- Are customer data encrypted at rest and in transit?
- What encryption standards do you use (e.g., AES-256, TLS 1.2/1.3)?
- How are encryption keys managed?

3. Incident Response
- Do you have an incident response plan?
- How fast do you notify customers if a breach occurs?
- What are your procedures for handling security incidents?

4. Cloud Security
- Which cloud provider do you use (AWS, GCP, Azure)?
- How do you secure cloud storage buckets?
- Do you follow the shared responsibility model?

5. Compliance & Certifications
- Are you SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR compliant?
- Do you undergo annual security audits?
- Do you conduct penetration testing?

6. Data Retention & Deletion
- How long do you store customer data?
- What is your data deletion process?
- Do customers have the right to request deletion?

7. Monitoring & Logging
- Do you monitor systems for suspicious activity?
- How long do you keep logs?
- What SIEM tools do you use?

8. Vendor Risk Management
- How do you evaluate third-party vendors?
- Do you ensure vendors follow security standards?
- Do you require DPAs (Data Processing Agreements)?

9. Identity & Authentication
- Do you use SSO (Single Sign-On)?
- Do you enforce password policies?
- Do you support role-based access control (RBAC)?

10. Testing & Vulnerability Management
- Do you run vulnerability scans?
- Do you have a patch management policy?
- How quickly do you apply security updates?

11. AI & Ethical Use (New Trend)
- How do you reduce AI model bias?
- Do you ensure transparency in AI decisions?
- How do you secure AI training data?

#### Q: What advice would you give to someone who is just starting their career in GRC?
My best recommendation (especially as you kickstart your GRC career) is to volunteer some of your time to respond to prospective-client and client security questionnaires, as doing so exposes you to the most common questions that they have about your company and/or product and will give you a sort of crash course into your security practices. As you work through the questions, you may find areas of your security program that you can improve, whether that be through improvements to policies, customer-facing documentation (like security and compliance program white papers), or even technical controls.

After spending your first year immersing yourself in as much GRC work as you, I would start to identify what specialization(s) you have a passion in – whether that's auditing and certifications, data governance, third party risk management, etc. Once you've identified what you're passionate about, you can make a better determination on the certification(s) you wish to pursue to better distinguish yourself in an increasingly competitive job market.
