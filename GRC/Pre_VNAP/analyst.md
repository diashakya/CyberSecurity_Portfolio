## SecurityPal Ethics
SecurityPal is a company that helps businesses handle security questionnaires — the long lists of questions companies ask each other to check whether their data is safe. These questionnaires are extremely important in B2B cybersecurity, especially when companies want to work together.

SecurityPal has just reached a big milestone:

🎉 They answered 2 million security questions!

And large companies like OpenAI, Airtable, Figma, and Stack Overflow trust them for this work.

🧩 Why These 2 Million Questions Matter

Security questionnaires are getting:

Bigger (more questions)

More complicated (topics like ESG, AI ethics, cloud security)

More urgent (companies want fast security approvals)

On average, each questionnaire now has 113 questions.

Many businesses still send these questionnaires in Excel, but more are moving to online portals.

⭐ How SecurityPal Started

The founder, Pukar Hamal, saw companies constantly delayed because of long and repetitive security questionnaires.

He wanted to simplify the process so businesses could close deals faster.

The company grew from a small 8-person remote team to a global operation.

They opened the SecurityPal Operations Command Center (SOCC) in Nepal.

They raised $21 million from investors.

🚀 Key Things SecurityPal Built

SecurityPal built many tools to make the process smoother:

SecurityPal Prime — answers questionnaires within 24 hours

SOCC — 24/7/365 operations

Multilingual support — answers in different languages

AI Copilot — uses AI to generate faster, more accurate answers

Vendor Assessment — checks third-party risks

Assurance Profile — helps companies show their security posture clearly

🔍 What SecurityPal Learns From 2 Million Questions

Companies are asking more about:

Data protection

Access control

Incident management

Cloud security

ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance)

AI ethics (fairness, transparency, accountability)

New laws like DORA, NIS2, and NIST CSF 2.0 are also forcing companies to be more strict about security.

⚙️ How SecurityPal Actually Works

Their process uses AI + expert analysts:

AI reads and understands the questionnaire.

Human analysts clarify details with the client.

They use a huge Knowledge Library (past answered questions) to write accurate responses.

They finish questionnaires in 70 hours, and under 12 hours with SP Prime.

They review client edits and continuously improve.

🛡️ Impact on Businesses

SecurityPal helps businesses:

Close deals faster

Improve their security

Stay compliant with regulations

Build trust with customers

Reduce workload for internal teams

📚 Case Study (Simple Version)

Productiv, a company, used to take 2 weeks to fill questionnaires.
With SecurityPal, they now just review answers in 30 minutes, and the whole process finishes in 3–4 days.
This saves time and helps them focus on security risks instead of paperwork.

🔮 Future of SecurityPal

Keep improving AI tools

Adapt to new cybersecurity rules

Help companies manage supply chain risks

Support stricter requirements around AI security

They want a future where companies can quickly, safely, and confidently work together without delays.

Q. Based on Anthony Sielczak's insights, what is one effective strategy for navigating the early stages of a career in GRC?
Volunteer to respond to client security questionnaires to understand security practices

Q: What advice would you give to someone who is just starting their career in GRC?
A: My best recommendation (especially as you kickstart your GRC career) is to volunteer some of your time to respond to prospective-client and client security questionnaires, as doing so exposes you to the most common questions that they have about your company and/or product and will give you a sort of crash course into your security practices. As you work through the questions, you may find areas of your security program that you can improve, whether that be through improvements to policies, customer-facing documentation (like security and compliance program white papers), or even technical controls.

After spending your first year immersing yourself in as much GRC work as you, I would start to identify what specialization(s) you have a passion in – whether that's auditing and certifications, data governance, third party risk management, etc. Once you've identified what you're passionate about, you can make a better determination on the certification(s) you wish to pursue to better distinguish yourself in an increasingly competitive job market.
