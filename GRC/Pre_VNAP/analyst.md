## SecurityPal Ethics
SecurityPal is a company that helps businesses handle security questionnaires — the long lists of questions companies ask each other to check whether their data is safe. These questionnaires are extremely important in B2B cybersecurity, especially when companies want to work together.

SecurityPal has just reached a big milestone:

🎉 They answered 2 million security questions!

And large companies like OpenAI, Airtable, Figma, and Stack Overflow trust them for this work.

🧩 Why These 2 Million Questions Matter

Security questionnaires are getting:

Bigger (more questions)

More complicated (topics like ESG, AI ethics, cloud security)

More urgent (companies want fast security approvals)

On average, each questionnaire now has 113 questions.

Many businesses still send these questionnaires in Excel, but more are moving to online portals.

⭐ How SecurityPal Started

The founder, Pukar Hamal, saw companies constantly delayed because of long and repetitive security questionnaires.

He wanted to simplify the process so businesses could close deals faster.

The company grew from a small 8-person remote team to a global operation.

They opened the SecurityPal Operations Command Center (SOCC) in Nepal.

They raised $21 million from investors.

🚀 Key Things SecurityPal Built

SOCC — 24/7/365 operations

Multilingual support — answers in different languages

AI Copilot — uses AI to generate faster, more accurate answers

🔍 What SecurityPal Learns From 2 Million Questions
