The term bit is an abbreviation of “binary digit” and represents the smallest piece of data. Humans interpret words and pictures, computers interpret only patterns of bits.

Every input device (mouse, keyboard, voice-activated receiver) will translate human interaction into binary code for the CPU to process and store. Every output device (printer, speakers, monitors, etc.) will take binary data and translate it back into human recognizable form. Within the computer itself, all data is processed and stored as binary.
