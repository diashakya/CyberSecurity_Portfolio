Local networks come in all sizes. They can range from simple networks consisting of two computers, to networks connecting hundreds of thousands of devices.

Networks installed in small offices, or homes and home offices, are referred to as small office/home office (SOHO) networks. SOHO networks let you share resources such as printers, documents, pictures, and music, between a few local users.

Communication over a network is usually more efficient and less expensive than traditional forms of communication, such as regular mail or long distance phone calls. Networks allow for rapid communication such as email and instant messaging, and provide consolidation and access to information stored on network servers.

Business and SOHO networks usually provide a shared connection to the internet. The internet is considered a "network of networks" because it is literally made up of thousands of local networks that are connected to each other.

Types of Local networks

1. Small Home Networks
Small home network connect a few computers to each other and to the internet

2. Small Office and Home Office
The SOHO network allows computers in a home office or a remote office to connect to a corporate network, or access centralized, shared resources.

3. World Wide Networks
The internet is a network of networks that connects hundreds of millions of computers world-wide.

4. Mobile Devices
The internet connects more computing devices than just desktop and laptop computers. There are devices all around that you may interact with on a daily basis that are also connected to the internet. These include mobile devices, home devices, and a variety of other connected devices.
Such as Smartphone, Tablet, Smartwatch, Smart Glasses

5. Connected Home Devices
Many of the things in your home can also be connected to the internet so that they can be monitored and configured remotely. Such as Security System, Appliances, Smart TV, Gaming Console etc.

6. Other Connected Devices
There are also many connected devices found in the world outside your home that provide convenience and useful, or even vital, information.
Such as:

i. Smart Cars
Many modern cars can connect to the internet to access maps, audio and video content, or information about a destination. They can even send a text message or email if there is an attempted theft or call for assistance in case of an accident. These cars can also connect to smartphones and tablets to display information about the different engine systems, provide maintenance alerts, or display the status of the security system.

ii. RFID Tags
Radio frequency identification (RFIDs) tags can be placed in or on objects to track them or monitor sensors for many conditions.

iii. Sensors and Actuators
Connected sensors can provide temperature, humidity, wind speed, barometric pressure, and soil moisture data. Actuators can then be automatically triggered based on current conditions.

iv. Medical Devices
Medical devices such as pacemakers, insulin pumps, and hospital monitors provide users or medical professionals with direct feedback or alerts when vital signs are at specific levels.
