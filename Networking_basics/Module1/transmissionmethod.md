After the data is transformed into a series of bits, it must be converted into signals that can be sent across the network media to its destination.A signal consists of electrical or optical patterns that are transmitted from one connected device to another.

Media refers to the physical medium on which the signals are transmitted.
- for eg: copper wire, fiber-optic cable, and electromagnetic waves through the air.

There are three common methods of signal transmission used in networks:

- Electrical signals - Transmission is achieved by representing data as electrical pulses on copper wire.
- Optical signals - Transmission is achieved by converting the electrical signals into light pulses.
- Wireless signals - Transmission is achieved by using infrared, microwave, or radio waves through the air

In most homes and small businesses, network signals are transmitted across copper wires (cables) or Wi-Fi enabled wireless connections. Larger networks employ fiber-optic cables in order to reliably carry signals for longer distances.

## Bandwidth and Throughput

Bandwidth is the capacity of a medium to carry data. Digital bandwidth measures the amount of data that can flow from one place to another in a given amount of time. Bandwidth is typically measured in the number of bits that (theoretically) can be sent across the media in a second. Common bandwidth measurements are as follows:

Thousands of bits per second (Kbps)
Millions of bits per second (Mbps)
Billions of bits per second (Gbps)
Throughput does not usually match the specified bandwidth. Many factors influence throughput including:

The amount of data being sent and received over the connection
The latency created by the number of network devices encountered between source and destination
Latency refers to the amount of time, including delays, for data to travel from one given point to another.
