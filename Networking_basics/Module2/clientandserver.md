All computers connected to a network that participate directly in network communication are classified as hosts. Hosts can send and receive messages on the network. In modern networks, computer hosts can act as a client, a server, or both, as shown in the figure. The software installed on the computer determines which role the computer plays.

### Server
Servers are hosts that have software installed which enable them to provide information, like email or webpages, to other hosts on the network.

Every destination that you visit online is provided to you by a server located somewhere on a network that is connected to the global internet.

### Client
Clients are computer hosts that have software installed that enables the hosts to request and display the information obtained from the server. An example of client software is a web browser, such as Internet Explorer, Safari, Mozilla Firefox or Chrome.

Types
1. Email = The email server runs email server software. Clients use mail client software, such as Microsoft Outlook, to access email on the server.

2. Web = The web server runs web server software. Clients use browser software, such as Window Internet Explorer, to access web pages on the server.

3. File = The file server stores corporate and user files in a central location. The client devices access these files with client software such as the Window File Explorer.
